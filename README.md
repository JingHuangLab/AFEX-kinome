## Installation

See [AFEXplorer](https://github.com/JingHuangLab/AFEXplorer) for more info. Note that `hmmer` needs to be installed in the current environment to support Kincore. Download of Alphafold2 Model parameters can be found in [google-deepmind/alphafold](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold).

## Benchmark Data Download

Download the benchmark dataset used for AFEX-kinome from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JingHuangLab/AFEX-kinome/releases):

## Additional notes

When visualizing AFEX-impute models in PyMOL, enable the "all_states" option to display the bound ligands.
